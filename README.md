# Image-Captioning
* Develop a robust CNN-LSTM model for image captioning using the Flickr8 dataset.
* First developed a baseline model with a choosen CNN-LSTM architecture and evaluated its performance.
* Then we modified the baseline model keeping the architecture of LSTM the same. In the modified baseline model, we enhanced both vision and language embeddings using techniques like Beam Search, Single-Head and Multi-Head Attention, thus improving the model's accuracy and efficiency.
* Compared modified baseline with original baseline model using BLEU and METEOR scores, yielding a highly improved image captioning system for diverse images.
